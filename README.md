# CodeWars-Kata
Daily coding exercises from codewars.com

The current goal is to reach 100 consecutive days (9-30-2017 to 01-07-2018) of solving at least 1 kata each day.
The goal of this project is to learn something new everyday about any programming language of interest or to become better at programming practice.
